# DayPlanner

My day planner is pretty basic right now. The text input column works, and if a user inputs information and prints it then they have a planner for the current date, but I was not able to get the save function to work. I also could not get the rest of the time element with the current time then changing the colors depending on the time of day. I know I also did not get the local storage to work either. I know that a couple of the requirements are missing.

At least with the extended time I was able to get more done than I would have. I try stuff out and then nothing happens and I also spend time researching how to do the code. Even though this is basic I do think I am getting an understanding of the materials. I'm still pretty slow with getting the homework done and wish I had more time to dedicate to homework. I spend almost every moment I can on homework and reviewing materials.
